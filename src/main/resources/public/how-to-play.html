        <h1 style="margin-top:20px;">How To Play 'Kalaha'</h1>
        <p>The Kalaha board is made up of two rows of six pits (holes) each.
            Six "stones" are placed in each of the 12 pits.
            Each player has a "Kalaha" (a store) to his/her right side of the Kalaha board.</p>

        <h1 class="with-border">Objective</h1>
        <p>The objective of the game is to collect the most stones by the end of the game.</p>

        <h1 class="with-border">Game Play</h1>
        <table>
        	<tr>
	            <td>
	                <p>1. The game begins with one player picking up all of the stones in any one of the pits on his/her
	                    side.
	                </p>
	                <p>2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each Kalaha until the stones
	                    run out.
	                </p>
	                <p>3. If you run into your own Kalaha, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Kalaha, skip it and continue moving to the next Kalaha.</p>
	                <p>4. If the last piece you drop is in your own Kalaha, you take another turn.</p>
	                <p>5. If the last piece you drop is in an empty Kalaha
							on your side, you capture that piece and any stones in the Kalaha
							directly opposite.</p>
	            </td>
	            <td>
	                <p>6. Always place all captured stones in your Kalaha.</p>
	                <p>7. The game ends when all six pits on one side of the Kalaha board are empty.</p>
	                <p>8. The player who still has stones on his/her side of the board when the game ends captures all of those stones.</p>
	                <p>9. Count all the stones in each Kalaha. The winner is the player with the most stones.</p>
